# README

The code in this repo supports the article originally published on [my blog](https://www.colby.so/posts/turbo-8-refresh-sorting) on implementing a sortable table with Ruby on Rails and Turbo 8's page refresh feature. The code in the main branch is the starting point, the code in the `finished-project` branch is the complete project as seen at the end of the blog.

You can pull this code down and follow along with the article by running `bin/setup` to install gems and create the database and then `bin/rails db:migrate` and `bin/dev`.
