# README

The code in this repo supports these articles originally published on my blog:
- [Turbo 8 refresh sorting](https://www.colby.so/posts/turbo-8-refresh-sorting)
- [Turbo 8 search and filter](https://www.colby.so/posts/turbo-8-search-and-filter)

The code in the main branch is the starting point for the series, the code in the `finished-project` branch is the complete project at the end of the first article. The `sort-and-filter` branch contains the finished code at the end of the second article.

You can pull this code down and follow along with the article by running `bin/setup` to install gems and create the database and then `bin/rails db:migrate` and `bin/dev`.
